# lazy-writeup-tool
I had to create an incentive to get back into making writeups so my lazy ass made this tool to automate the creation and population of necessary directories and scans. Yes, it's trash, but it works.

### Usage
***
Put your stuff in the .env file so the program will run. Minimal setup is required; you probably have all the python modules already you boy scout.
Comment out the function(s) you don't want done. Boom, you're already hardening my apps; good job.
